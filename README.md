# PyCrypto
 Simple AES Encryption and Decryption system using Python

## Requarements
* Python 2.x

Python Lybrary
* AES 256
* Crypto.Hash
* Crypto.Cipher
* os
* random
* sys
* pkg_resources (optional)

## Details
This project is created for those who want to work with Cryptography.
This will give you the simple basic Algorithm how we can use encryption and decryption to a file.
If You are doing any project, this will help you a lot :)

## Installing
* Forke my project
* clone the project to tour pc
* open a terminal and goto the project directory
* hit "pycrypto.py" in the Terminal

## Running the TEST

### For Encryption:-
* 1. Run "pycrypto.py" from "PyCrypto" directory. This will ask you to encrypt (or) decrypt.
* 2. Hit E for Encrypting file "testme.txt" that present in the same directory
* 3. Then give a password (Remember the password!)
* 4. Done!
### For Decryption:-
* 1. Run "pycrypto.py" from "PyCrypto" directory. This will ask you to encrypt (or) decrypt.
* 2. Hit D for Decrypting file "(encrypted)testme.txt" that present in the same directory
* 3. Then give a password (The same password that you used for encryption)
* 4. Done!
